Description: An implementation of the network fingerprint framework that introduced 
  in paper "Network fingerprint: a knowledge-based characterization of biomedical 
  networks" (Cui, 2015) <doi:10.1038/srep13286>. This method worked by making 
  systematic comparisons to a set of well-studied "basic networks", measuring 
  both the functional and topological similarity.  A biological could be
  characterized as a spectrum-like vector consisting of similarities to basic 
  networks. It shows great potential in biological network study.
